- `_conformToMask` is throwing away "/" input from dates. If the "/" are adjacent, all of them will be removed until a user-input character is read.
- The Mask functions need to return both the array-based mask pattern, along with some meta-data that may be created by the mask function.  In this case, we need to know about which characters are not part of the date format groups.
- functions can be user defined, so changing their output is technically a breaking change to the API.
- changes are needed to `_conformToMask` that will detect the groups of slashes, and increase the loop index to "get to the next section".
